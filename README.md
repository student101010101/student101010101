## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate tech enthusiast with a strong desire to grow my skills, particularly in web development, Linux, and system administration. As I continue to explore the world of coding, Iâ€™m particularly interested in building dynamic web applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly. Iâ€™m diving deep into front-end and back-end technologies, honing my skills in languages like JavaScript, Python, and frameworks like React.

Another area Iâ€™m keen to expand my knowledge in is Linux. Iâ€™m dedicated to learning the ins and outs of system administration, as well as automation tools to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. The power and flexibility of Linux is something I find both fascinating and rewarding, and Iâ€™m excited to dive deeper into server management and automation scripting.

Outside of my tech journey, Iâ€™m also a huge fan of music, especially metal. The energy and creativity within the genre inspire me, whether Iâ€™m attending concerts or discovering new bands. I find that music, much like coding, is all about passion and expression. Combining my love for tech and music, I strive to bring creativity, discipline, and problem-solving into every project I tackle.
